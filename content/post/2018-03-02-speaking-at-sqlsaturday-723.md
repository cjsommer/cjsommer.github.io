If you are a SQL Server professional and are interested in spending a day with a bunch of other like-minded individuals, SQL Saturday is for you. It’s a day chock full of SQL Server related presentations given by other members of the community.

This year I'm excited to give 2 presentations! 

Painting with PowerShell. I've given this presentation before and am excited to be able to do it here again.

My newest presentation is about the nuances of Running SQL Server in Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS).

If neither of my sessions are what you are looking for, that’s OK. There are plenty of other topics to choose from. With sessions geared toward Database Development, Database Administration, Business Intellignece, Database Security and even Professional Development, SQL Saturday offers a wide variety of content for everyone.

I promise that you will not regret attending! Register now!

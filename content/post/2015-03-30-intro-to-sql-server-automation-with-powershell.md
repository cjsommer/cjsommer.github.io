March 26th, 2015, a date which will live in infamy! 

Well, at least for me it will. March 26th, 2015 marks the date I gave my first presentation at my local SQL PASS user group meeting. Here is the picture as proof!

I was very excited to be able to share some of my knowledge with everyone who showed up. I hope to be able to do it again some time. 

I am going to keep this post short and sweet. I just wanted to get it out here so I could share the PowerPoint presentation and the demo scripts, both of which are attached at the bottom of this blog post. Hoping someone will find them useful.

I do want to mention that some of the scripts in the demos were coded for the machine that I gave them on, so I can't promise that they will work right out the the box for you. Don't let that discourage you though. Troubleshooting broken scripts can be a great learning exercise. Hack around and see what you can figure out on your own. If you get stuck or have any questions feel free to ask. I will be happy to respond.

Happy scripting!

I haven't blogged in quite some time but figured this was post worthy.

It’s with a heavy heart that I share that I was among those impacted by the recent layoffs at [Olo](https://www.olo.com/). December would’ve marked six years with the company—but sadly my time there has come to an end. I had the privilege of working alongside many incredible people, and I will truly miss working with all of you. :face_holding_back_tears:

But on to another chapter for me. It’s time for me to take a step back, regroup, and prepare for whatever comes next. Life has always taken me where I needed to be even though the "why" was sometimes unclear.

Wishing all my former coworkers nothing but the best. So long [Olo](https://www.olo.com/), and thanks for all the fish! :fishing_pole_and_fish:

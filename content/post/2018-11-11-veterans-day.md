I was fortunate to have attended PASS Summit again this year. As an added bonus they had a Birds of a Feather luncheon table for Veterans every day. I sat at the table every day and met a number of different veterans from all branches of service. I even met someone who had served in the British Army. It was wonderful to sit around a table and share war stories with you all. It added a very special dimension to my Summit this year. 

To all of the PASS veterans I met as well as ALL veterans from all around the globe.

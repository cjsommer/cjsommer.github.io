Did that say free? Why yes, yes it did! But don't let the price tag fool ya, these are some pretty nice little utilities.

Another blog post inspired by a question on Twitter.

I went to SQL Saturday #383 a few weeks ago and noticed a handful of performance testing utilities being mentioned or used during many of the presentations. I have seen them all mentioned or used in demos before, but I have very little experience using them myself. I thought it would be nice to gather them all in one place for future reference, and I can definitely foresee a more in depth review of each down the road.

Below you will find the name of the utility, a brief description of what it is primarily used for (taken from the creator's website), and the URL of the creator's website.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Warning: These utilities are made to put a significant load on your database server so use at your own risk. Make sure your resume is up to date if you choose to run them in production!</strong></span>

In all seriousness, understand what these tools do before you attempt to run them in any of your environments. If you run these utilities against a server that uses a shared resource like a SAN, they can affect other hosts using that SAN. If you run them against a VM, they can impact othere guests on the same host. This advice really goes for any tool you might use, but a couple of these have the ability to significantly impact performance on a live system.

&lt;p&gt;If you are a SQL Server professional and are interested in spending a day with a bunch of other like-minded individuals, SQL Saturday is for you. It&amp;rsquo;s a day chock full of SQL Server related presentations given by other members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a glimpse of my presentation on SQL Server Automation using PowerShell taken from the SQL Saturday event page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PowerShell isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing that&amp;rsquo;s OK. There are plenty of other topics to choose from. With sessions geared toward Database Development, Database Administration, Business Intellignece, Database Security and even Professional Development, SQL Saturday offers a wide variety of content for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at SQL Saturday 487 in Ottawa on April 16, 2016</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2016-04-03-speaking-at-sql-saturday-487-in-ottawa-on-april-16-2016/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2016-04-03-speaking-at-sql-saturday-487-in-ottawa-on-april-16-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&amp;lt;img alt=&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; class=&amp;lsquo;alignright size-full wp-image-1238 &amp;lsquo;src=&amp;rsquo;/img/2016/04/img_570152b22dc45.png&amp;rsquo; /&amp;gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the SQL Saturday 386 leadership and the army of volunteers they brought along. It was a very well run event. The venue was nice, everything was very well organized, the people were amazingly helpful and friendly, and it made the perfect place for me to turn my presentation up a notch. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much of a calming effect can be felt when you are surrounded by such an inviting and amazing group of people. That&amp;rsquo;s really something that I love about the SQL Server community in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SQL Saturday Albany (#sqlsat386) - Look Who's Speaking!</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-06-09-speaking-at-sqlsat386/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 08:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-06-09-speaking-at-sqlsat386/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why so excited you may ask? Because this will be my first presentation at a SQL Saturday! I have given this presentation at my local chapter, and I am really excited to present to a new audience. I am also looking forward to getting some feedback at SQL Saturday to help me make it better. I want to know what people think overall; what they liked or didn&amp;rsquo;t like; what I did well or what I could do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Follow the yellow brick what?

&lt;p&gt;If you would have asked me 2 years ago if I had ever considered public speaking my response would have been a definitive no! In the words of the cowardly lion, &amp;ldquo;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Not no way! Not no how!&amp;quot;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Well, a lot has changed since then. This is the story of how I went from being the cowardly lion to presenting at my local SQL PASS chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Intro to SQL Server Automation with PowerShell</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-03-30-intro-to-sql-server-automation-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 18:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-03-30-intro-to-sql-server-automation-with-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;March 26th, 2015, a date which will live in infamy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least for me it will. March 26th, 2015 marks the date I gave my first presentation at my local SQL PASS user group meeting. Here is the picture as proof!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very excited to be able to share some of my knowledge with everyone who showed up. I hope to be able to do it again some time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

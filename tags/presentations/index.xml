It was a very well run event. The venue was nice, everything was very well organized, the people were amazingly helpful and friendly, and it made the perfect place for me to turn my presentation up a notch. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much of a calming effect can be felt when you are surrounded by such an inviting and amazing group of people.</description></item><item><title>SQL Saturday Albany (#sqlsat386) - Look Who's Speaking!</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-06-09-speaking-at-sqlsat386/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 08:15:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-06-09-speaking-at-sqlsat386/</guid><description>Why so excited you may ask? Because this will be my first presentation at a SQL Saturday! I have given this presentation at my local chapter, and I am really excited to present to a new audience. I am also looking forward to getting some feedback at SQL Saturday to help me make it better. I want to know what people think overall; what they liked or didn&amp;rsquo;t like; what I did well or what I could do better.</description></item><item><title>Follow the yellow brick what?

If you would have asked me 2 years ago if I had ever considered public speaking my response would have been a definitive no! In the words of the cowardly lion, &amp;ldquo;Not no way! Not no how!&amp;quot;. Well, a lot has changed since then. This is the story of how I went from being the cowardly lion to presenting at my local SQL PASS chapter.</description></item><item><title>Intro to SQL Server Automation with PowerShell</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-03-30-intro-to-sql-server-automation-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 18:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-03-30-intro-to-sql-server-automation-with-powershell/</guid><description>March 26th, 2015, a date which will live in infamy!
Well, at least for me it will. March 26th, 2015 marks the date I gave my first presentation at my local SQL PASS user group meeting. Here is the picture as proof!
I was very excited to be able to share some of my knowledge with everyone who showed up. I hope to be able to do it again some time.</description></item></channel></rss>

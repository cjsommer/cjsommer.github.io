I was fortunate to have attended PASS Summit again this year. As an added bonus they had a Birds of a Feather luncheon table for Veterans every day. I sat at the table every day and met a number of different veterans from all branches of service. I even met someone who had served in the British Army. It was wonderful to sit around a table and share war stories with you all.</description></item><item><title>Women in Technology - All are welcome!</title><link>https://uwww.cjsommer.com/post/2018-03-27-women-in-technology-sqlsaturday-723/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://uwww.cjsommer.com/post/2018-03-27-women-in-technology-sqlsaturday-723/</guid><description>I was at SQL Saturday 723 in Rochester, NY last weekend. I was selected to deliver 2 sessions, and I planned to fill the rest of my schedule watching other session during the day. Overall this was another great SQL Saturday. But that&amp;rsquo;s not why I&amp;rsquo;m here today&amp;hellip;
A new session emerged in the lunch timeslot this year. The Women in Technology Panel Discussion.
This is the first time SQL Saturday Rochester has ever done a Women in Technology panel.</description></item></channel></rss>

Just wanted to put a quick post out there for the people who follow me. I very recently made a switch from Wordpress to Jekyll blogging platform and I am certain it will come with a few hiccups. At the moment I don't have comments enabled, although I hope to add that feature this weekend. Also I do need to go through all of my posts and make sure images and code snippets all look how they're supposed to. That will definitely be a work in progress for a bit as I have a number of posts to go through.

Regardless, thanks for stopping by. I truly appreciate the traffic and look forward to blogging for some time to comes. Feel free to reach out to me via email, twitter for any issues with the blog so I can fix it.

If you are a SQL Server professional and are interested in spending a day with a bunch of other like-minded individuals, SQL Saturday is for you. It’s a day chock full of SQL Server related presentations given by other members of the community.

Here is a glimpse of my presentation on SQL Server Automation using PowerShell taken from the SQL Saturday event page.

If PowerShell isn’t your thing that’s OK. There are plenty of other topics to choose from. With sessions geared toward Database Development, Database Administration, Business Intellignece, Database Security and even Professional Development, SQL Saturday offers a wide variety of content for everyone.

I promise that you will not regret attending! Register now!

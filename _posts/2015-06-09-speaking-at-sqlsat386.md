So on June 3rd I got this email from Edward Pollack.

I had submitted a few weeks earlier and had been waiting for this email ever since. Originally, call for speakers was supposed to end on June 1st, but it got extended to June 7th to allow for a few more submissions. My anticipation grew with each passing day and I didn't really expect a notification of any kind until after June 7th. I was very surprised to find this in my inbox on June 3rd, and needless to say I am very excited to have been selected!

Why so excited you may ask? Because this will be my first presentation at a SQL Saturday! I have given this presentation at my local chapter, and I am really excited to present to a new audience. I am also looking forward to getting some feedback at SQL Saturday to help me make it better. I want to know what people think overall; what they liked or didn't like; what I did well or what I could do better. 

My session is titled, "Introduction to SQL Server Automation with PowerShell". Rather than re-type my abstract and all that jazz, below is a screenshot of the abstract from the SQL Saturday page. If you click on it the link will take you to it on the SQL Saturday website.

So if you are going to SQL Saturday Albany, and are looking to learn a little about using PowerShell to automate tasks in SQL Server, stop on by! I'd love to meet you and share some of the things I've learned along my journey as a SQL Server DBA! 

And let me just plug SQL Saturday in general. If you work with SQL Server in any capacity you should attend SQL Saturday. It's a full day of FREE SQL Server learning and networking with other SQL Server professionals! Don't let the price tag fool you as FREE is definitely not indicative of the quality of these events. 

SQL Saturday Albany is being held July 25th, 2015. Follow the link below and register. You will not regret it! I look forward to seeing you there!

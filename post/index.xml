Right from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s website: The SQL Server Query Store feature provides you with insight on query plan choice and performance. It simplifies performance troubleshooting by helping you quickly find performance differences caused by query plan changes. Query Store automatically captures a history of queries, plans, and runtime statistics, and retains these for your review. It separates data by time windows so you can see database usage patterns and understand when query plan changes happened on the server.</description></item><item><title>Happy Veterans Day to my SQL Brothers and Sisters!</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2018-11-11-veterans-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2018-11-11-veterans-day/</guid><description>Thank you all for your service!

One of the things we DBA&amp;rsquo;s do is configure tempdb to have multiple data files (if needed). Not going to go into the depths of why in this post, but adding multiple data files can help alleviate contention in tempdb. Until today I didn&amp;rsquo;t think you could do this in RDS. I guess I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even tried because you can&amp;rsquo;t do anything to master, model or the msdb databases, so I just assumed tempdb was off limits as well.</description></item><item><title>Beware the automated backup window when running native SQL Server backups in RDS</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2017-08-04-rds-beware-backup-window/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2017-08-04-rds-beware-backup-window/</guid><description>Beware the automated backup window when running native SQL Server backups in RDS If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever fired up an RDS instance you know you can set an automated backup window for your instance.

We have a fairly complex and secure network environment. Multiple networks across multiple data centers with multiple firewalls in between. Because of this, one of the first things I typically look at is connectivity between application and database servers.</description></item><item><title>So I have a new home!

In my SQL Server environment we backup our databases to local disk.

You can run this on both the PRIMARY and SECONDARY replicas, which we have discovered may or may not be consistent.

In this post I am going to show you a couple of my go-to methods for troubleshooting slow performing queries in SQL Server. This is not a &amp;ldquo;ZOMG my SQL Server is slow&amp;rdquo; list. This post is more geared to when I have been tasked to dig into a very specific query.</description></item><item><title>T-SQL Tuesday 73 – Naughty or Nice?</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-12-08-t-sql-tuesday-73-naughty-or-nice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 21:43:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-12-08-t-sql-tuesday-73-naughty-or-nice/</guid><description>As you work with SQL Server look around you. Is your environment Naughty or Nice? If it is Naughty what’s wrong with it? What would you do to fix it? Do you have a scrooge that is giving you the Christmas chills? Perhaps you have servers of past, present, and future haunting you. Maybe you are looking at SQL Server 2016 like some bright shining star in the east.</description></item><item><title>Identity Column Increment Value (EVEN/ODD)</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-11-17-identity-column-increment-value-evenodd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 22:11:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-11-17-identity-column-increment-value-evenodd/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Hey DBA&amp;rsquo;s, I have a thought about a really creative solution to this really hard problem.

To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called connection pooling, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections. Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.
Opening connections is a very expensive and time consuming operation. Connection pooling helps alleviate that by providing a reusable &amp;ldquo;pool&amp;rdquo; of connections that your application can share.</description></item><item><title>Running Parameterized Queries against SQL Server using PowerShell</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-10-13-running-parameterized-queries-against-sql-server-using-powershell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-10-13-running-parameterized-queries-against-sql-server-using-powershell/</guid><description>For many years I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about the implications of how I was retrieving data from my SQL Servers in PowerShell.

Strategies for managing an enterprise.
What do you think of when you hear the word enterprise? I used to think mainframes and big iron. I would think of sprawling server rooms with dozens of server racks. I used to think monstrous storage arrays and backup tape libraries as far as the eye could see. I used to think of a large employee base.</description></item><item><title>How many errors can the PowerShell error buffer hold?</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-08-04-how-many-errors-can-the-powershell-error-buffer-hold/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-08-04-how-many-errors-can-the-powershell-error-buffer-hold/</guid><description>PowerShell stores errors that it encounters in a circular error buffer variable named $Error. $Error also contains a count property to count the number of errors in the buffer. To figure out how many errors we could hold was pretty straight forward. All I had to do was create a script that generated an error and see how high $error.count got. At this point I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know if there was a maximum or not.</description></item><item><title>Present at SQL Saturday</title><link>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-07-28-present-at-sql-saturday-386-achievement-unlocked/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>cjsommer@gmail.com (Chris Sommer)</author><guid>https://www.cjsommer.com/post/2015-07-28-present-at-sql-saturday-386-achievement-unlocked/</guid><description>I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the SQL Saturday 386 leadership and the army of volunteers they brought along.

Well there&amp;rsquo;s really nothing wrong with SQL Agent.

I answered this twitter post a while back and figured it would make a fun blog post.
So what do I mean that the database is stuck in single user mode? Simply speaking, it means that the database is in single user mode and you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get it back into multi user mode. As an example I set my local AdventureWorks2012 database to single user mode, opened a session to that database, tried an alter database to get it back to multi user and this is what I got.</description></item><item><title>Using PowerShell to Export SQL Data to CSV.
